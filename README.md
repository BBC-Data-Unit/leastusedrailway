The loneliest railway station in Britain had something of a send-off before it was closed to the public.

[Redcar British Steel station saw an 800% rise in visitors during 2018-19](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51106246), having been named the least used station in the country by the Office of Rail and Road the year before

Those figures cover up to March 2019 and public access to the station shut in the December of that year.

As well as reporting on this year's list, we spoke to some of the people who helped lift the visitor figures to find out why they wanted to go to the stations no one uses.

As for this yearâ€™s loneliest, it's a tie between Stanlow and Thornton in Cheshire and Denton in Greater Manchester, which had 46 entries and exits each in 2018-19.

People wanting to visit Denton will have to time it right. There are only two trains stopping there, one in each direction, on a Saturday morning and it's a request stop.
